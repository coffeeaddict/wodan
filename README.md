# wodan

A simpler god, less bells, more whistles and two wolves and ravens named
Geri, Freki, Hugin and Munin.

That's what I wanted when I set out to create wodan in an attempt to replace
mojombo's God.

Although wodan was (and still could be) a lot of fun; I discontinue. There
is no way I can quickly match up to this:
